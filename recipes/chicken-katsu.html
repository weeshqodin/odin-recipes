        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
                <li>Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
                <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
                <li>Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
                <li>Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p>Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade chicken katsu:</p>
            <ol>
